# NLP Hashtag & Caption Recommendation System

This project implements an NLP-based recommendation system for suggesting relevant hashtags and captions for social media posts.

## Problem
Choosing relevant hashtags is time-consuming and often inconsistent. This system automates hashtag selection using semantic similarity.

## Approach
- Text preprocessing
- Embedding generation (TF-IDF / Sentence-BERT)
- Similarity-based recommendation

## Results
The system produces contextually relevant hashtags for unseen captions.
